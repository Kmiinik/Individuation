# Individuation
A game made for the GBA Jam 2021. 

This being my first game on the gba, as well as my first time using c++, Any code here that isnt directly copy pasted is likely awful, So while I do not reccomend using any of this code, perhaps you can use it as a learning experience.

this was also made with the Butano engine, which I highly reccomend.

I wasn't sure if I had to include the butano license, so just to be safe I did.

Also, Hello Github, this is my first thing here.
